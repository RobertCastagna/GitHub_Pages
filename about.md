I'm Robert Castagna, a Data Engineer based in Toronto. I specialize in client analytics and administrative reporting. My day-to-day involves building and maintaining 
data pipelines written in Python. The code is orchestrated in AWS Glue and leverages PySpark for compute optimization. I also spend time developing our new data architecture inside Snowflake as we have taken on a project to decentralize data at our company. Following best practices and Kimball's methodology for data warehousing, we are working on a scalable, and deployable infrastructure. I am always looking for ways to improve our existing systems by keeping up to date with new release features spanning python 3.11 release notes, Spark 3.X automatic query optimization and beta features such as dynamic tables in Snowflake. 

Outside of work, you will either find me in the gym, on my mtb or researching and turning newest tech into a personal project. I follow Formula 1, the NHL and recently watched the 16 year old success story of Luke “the Nuke” Littler, a 16-year-old darts prodigy out of London, England earn himself a spot in the semi-finals of the World Championship.
